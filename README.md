This software generates d3 graphs from automatically extracted concepts from user input. The purpose of this project is to assist users to better understand a research topic through  d3 data visualization.

This software connects chatgpt with d3 graphs to generate concepts.  
By using a chatgpt api, it can take in the user input then store it then transfers it to the d3 code for data plotting or concept plotting.  
The main use of the d3 is to generate visualized concepts.  
After both of our apis finish their work we move to the website part which is html and css and java script. The website will include a “search bar” and a display text that asks the user what they are looking for. After the user inputs what they are looking for they will be directed into another page that has all the concepts plotted by the d3 api. I used the chatgpt api mainly to act as a search bar. This search is the main way for us to plot our concepts.
